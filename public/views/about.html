           POW-B was created as a partial requirement for the completion of the Mount Royal University Comp4513 Web III, taught by Randy Connolly.<br>

            <p class="about">
                     Sonia, a student in her third year of the Bachelor of Computer Information Services,
                has a passion for web design.  She is always the first to seek out new CSS frameworks.
                Embracing the learning, she lights up when she discovers a feature that allows the web
                site to sizzle.
                <br/>
                     There is way more to her than eye candy.  Her methodical style, her drive and persistence
                contribute to making her a valued team member.  She is calm and always willing to help
                even after some team mates keep deleting random div tags.  Her only fault -- she has
                a phobia of pressing the submit button â€“ what if we could have made it better? What if it
                goes to the wrong place? What if the wrong file gets sent to the wrong person?

            <p class="about">
                Nolan, a third year BCIS student at Mount Royal University has a balanced approach to problem solving.
                He combines minimalistic coding style with a good understanding of the tools at his disposal.
                He seeks counsel and support to rapidly develop the code he needs. <br/>
                While definitely fleet of foot, he exhibits very poor judgement when it comes to pro hockey.
                He  is an enthusiastic team mate.  He took on the challenge of developing the project structure,
                documenting what he was doing so the rest of us could follow his logic and jumped right in to get
                the login features up and running.  His only fault -- always cognizant of the goals to be met with
                an eye on how much time is left to meet them.

            <p class="about">
                Mark, the team leader.  The inspiration. Nowhere to be seen on March 17th, letting his Irish
                heritage get in the way of coming to class.  Having successfully guided the group through an MVC
                implementation of Assignment 1, he had prepared the group for MEAN development. <br />
                A hard working team mate.  A low key approach to solving problems.  He has successfully undergone
                treatment for OCD tendancies in his programming style.  Last assignment he was observed gyrating
                between the need to change poor programming techniques of others and letting the members learn and
                grow.  It was awful to observe.  We suspect tranquilizers were the ultimate solution to the problem,
                but who knows.

            <p class="about">
                James, approaching his 40th year of higher education, enjoys learning.  He loves learning
                so much that he relearns things multiple times, hence his commitment to try and document what
                the group does.  He tries to assure that the pieces fit together, make sense and are
                not superfluous to the intent.<br />
                He is a ravenous reader, but has an inability to read on line, so he is one of ABE Books
                best customers.  Such best sellers as jQuery in Easy Steps, PHP Web Services, and Textpattern
                Solutions line his floor.  He has a knack for finding bugs, being bamboozled by abstraction and
                going to bed before Nolan gets up.   Even though Sonia knows he deletes div tags on purpose, Nolan
                puts up with his odd hours and Mark doesn't really believe anyone really wants to know that
                much, he has fun.
