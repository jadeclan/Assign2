controllers can be made into separate js files if a lot of work needs
to be done for that specific controller.
If the controller is relatively small it can be stored and created in the
public/app.js file under the specific .state() that creates the page you are
working on.

ex:
    .state('dashboard.settings', {
                    url: '/settings',
                    templateUrl: 'views/settings.html',
                    controller: function($scope, $http, $uibModal) {
                    }
           })
